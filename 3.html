  <h2>JavaScript</h2>

  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a> is a general-purpose, prototype-based, object-oriented <strong><u>scripting language</u></strong>. It is designed to be embedded in diverse applications and systems, without consuming much memory. JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but also inherits from Awk and Perl, with some indirect influence from Self in its object prototype system.</p>

  <p>JavaScript is dynamically typed, that is, programs do not declare variable types, and the type of a variable is unrestricted and can change at runtime. Source code can be generated at runtime and evaluated against an arbitrary scope. Typical implementations compile by translating source into an unspecified bytecode format, to check syntax and source consistency. Note that the ability to generate and interpret programs at runtime implies the presence of a compiler at runtime.</p>

  <p>JavaScript is a high-level scripting language that does not depend on or expose particular machine representations or operating system services. It provides automatic storage management, typically using a garbage collector. The language and the standard objects and functions documented in this specification provide no unsafe access to memory or other hardware resources.
